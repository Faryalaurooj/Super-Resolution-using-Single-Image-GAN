# Super-Resolution-using-Single-Image-GAN
# GANs are a type of generative networks which produce realistic images from a latent vector (“ or distribution”). Generally, a GAN comprises two networks: generator (G) whose purpose is to map latent code to images and discriminator (D) whose task is to judge if an image belongs to original dataset (real image) or if it was generated by generator network means it is a fake image. Performing against the discriminator, the generator network tries its level best to befool it, generating new images from the latent vector so the discriminator network may believe that these are real images.

#Generally GANs learn from large datasets in order to generate fake images, known as conditional GANs. THere is another class of GANs known as unconditional GANs because they do not rely on large amount of images to learn the representations and generate fake images. This catagory of GANs learn from internal statistical distribution of a single image and based on that, they produce multiple fake images. IN this repo, i have worked on an un-conditional GAN model to perform task of produce high resolution images from low resolution images. To perfrom this task, i used BSD-100 dataset. 

#THe results achieved with this work, were benchmarked against some top of the line super resolution GAN models like SRGAN ESRGAN and it was evaluated that the results were much higher with my SIngle image GAN model as compared to large dataset dependant SRGAN and ESRGAN models.
