GANs are a type of generative networks which produce realistic images from a latent vector (“ or distribution”). Generally, a GAN comprises two networks: generator (G) whose purpose is to map latent code to images and discriminator (D) whose task is to judge if an image belongs to the original dataset (real image) or if it was generated by the generator network, which means it is a fake image. Performing against the discriminator, the generator network tries its level best to befool it, generating new images from the latent vector so the discriminator network may believe that these are real images.

Generally, GANs learn from large datasets in order to generate fake images, known as conditional GANs. There is another class of GANs known as unconditional GANs because they do not rely on a large amount of images to learn the representations and generate fake images. This category of GANs learns from the internal statistical distribution of a single image and based on that, they produce multiple fake images. In this repo, I have worked on an unconditional GAN model to perform the task of producing high-resolution images from low-resolution images. To perform this task, I used the BSD-100 dataset.

The results achieved with this work were benchmarked against some top-of-the-line super-resolution GAN models like SRGAN and ESRGAN, and it was evaluated that the results were much better with my Single Image GAN model compared to large dataset-dependent SRGAN and ESRGAN models.

## DATA SET
I performed this task of super resolution utilizing the following data sets:

1. **BSD (Berkeley Segmentation Dataset)**: This dataset was introduced by David R. Martin et al. in "A Database of Human Segmented Natural Images and its Application to Evaluating Segmentation Algorithms and Measuring Ecological Statistics." It is used frequently for image denoising and super-resolution. The dataset is composed of a large variety of images ranging from natural images to object-specific such as plants, people, food, etc. BSD100 is the testing set of the Berkeley segmentation dataset BSD300.

2. **COWC (Cars Overhead With Context)**: This dataset was introduced by Mundhenk et al. in "A Large Contextual Dataset for Classification, Detection and Counting of Cars with Deep Learning." The Cars Overhead With Context (COWC) data set is a large set of annotated cars from overhead. It is useful for training a device such as a deep neural network to learn to detect and/or count cars. This code was tested with python 3.10.9, torch 1.12.1

## CODE

**Install dependencies**

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This code was tested with Python 3.10.9 and Torch 1.12.1.

## SUPER RESOLUTION

To super-resolve an image using this GAN model with the help of a single low-resolution image as input, place the low-resolution image inside the input/images folder and please run:

```
python SR.py --input_name <LR_image_file_name>
```
This will automatically train the model corresponding to 4x upsampling factor (if not exist already). THe model will appear in the folder with the name "TrainedModels" . For different SR factors, please specify it using the parameter --sr_factor when calling the function. Output high resolution image will automatically save into Output folder. Super resolution results on the BSD100 dataset can be download from the 'Downloads' folder.
